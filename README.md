I guess life, uh, finds a way. ðŸ¦–

These days if I'm not hacking on the keyboard I might be flying drones, watching/playing some kind of sports, smoking a brisket Texas BBQ style, being amazed by astronomy, listening to podcasts, or catching up on one of my favorite movies or television series.

As far as my career as a developer goes. Here's what the timeline looks like:

- 1995-96: `True BASIC` and `QBASIC` (and playing Solitaire, Minsweeper and loads of SkiFree, let's be honest)
- 1996-97: `Turbo Pascal`, `Turbo C++` and `Delphi`
- 1998: `Visual Basic 4/5` (first real programming job after high school)
- 1999: `HTML`, `CSS`, and `classic ASP` with `VBScript` and `JavaScript`. `ActiveX` and `COM/DCOM`. `T-SQL`/`PL-SQL`/`MS Access`. Just got into `DAO` as it was being replaced by `ADO`. So long Jet Database Engine! Oh, and also `Visual Source Safe`. #LongLiveSourceSafe #JustKidding #NotReally
- 2000: Hey what's this `RedHat Linux` OS all about? Seems safer to mess around with than Napster. Also what's this ".NET" thing Microsoft is releasing Beta versions of?
- 2001: `C#`, `ASP.NET`, `.NET Remoting`, and the dot com collapse. Which for some reason made me get into `JavaScript` more.
- 2002-2005: Lotsa `.NET` and `SQL Server`. `Vault` for source control.
- 2005-2010: Even more `SQL Server` including `SSRS`, `SSIS`, `SSAS`, and various `ETL` and `BI/Reporting` platforms. Still `C#` and `ASP.NET` on the dev side of things.
- 2011: `NodeJS`, `WPF`, `WCF`, `SVG`, `JSON`, (great acronym btw, always gets my attention) and `ASP.NET MVC`. `Subversion` for source control. Also `Augmented Reality` with `Unity` game dev platform.
- 2012-2014: More `NodeJS` and a long list of NPM Packages. More `.NET`. Started using `Git` for the first time. Also MVVM JS libraries like `Angular`, `Backbone` and `KnockoutJS`. Some `MongoDB` as well.
- 2015-2020: `Azure`, `.NET Core`, `Python`, `TypeScript` and `Microservices`, and launched a fantasy tennis game for a couple of years. Eclectic mixture of `TFS`, `VSTS` and `Git` for source control. `Jenkins` for CI/CD.
- 2021-Present: More `Microservices` running on `Azure` and a tiny bit of `AWS`, more `C#` and `ASP.NET Core` and also a healthy dose of `Flutter` and the `Dart` language for mobile dev. Also doing more work on `MacOS` these days using `XCode` and `Android Studio`. Full-time `Git` and `Azure DevOps` for source control and CI/CD.
- Misc: Currently playing around with .NET Maui and Blazor when time permits. Have a few side projects rolling around in my head too.
